# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My motivation was to start learning Javascript and I thought what a better way than to make a password generator . The reason I chose this project is to understand more in depth of variables loops, and looping through arrays. Then returning the array as a string again. The cool thing about this project is now I do not need to sit at the “Make your password” form for ever now. The biggest take away from this project I learned. Is that Javascripts reads characters in number form rather than as they appear on screen.  Then learning how to make the character code into upper and lower case  letters ,symboles, and numbers. The very last problem I had and it was the easiest of all… getting the code to reset and placing it with a new code. The code kept adding to the existing code and that was very frustrating. This was a huge celebration after resolving the issue.

function passReset() {
  code.length = 0;
  finalPass.length = 0;
}
